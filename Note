Today I made my first Git Repos and also was my first day of 7Days7Sites

I did not finish the text coloring or weight correct
I need to work on my CSS Grid arrangement
Work sooner than later

I did make it mobile and place all of the images to appear correctly
Not bad for my first follow along site. 

Onward to Day2
